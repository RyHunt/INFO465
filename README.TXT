This is a project for a VCU Information Systems class. The project was meant to be done with HTML, JS, and PHP. 

I went off the rails and used a Python framework called Django.

There are files in the main directory from the course. They will soon be removed. 

INFO465 folder contains all of the .py files and HTML templates. The rhunt folder contains project settings and information
should not be accessible to the web.
